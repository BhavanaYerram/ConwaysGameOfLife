 Problem Statement*
    
    Conway's game of life is played on an infinite 2d rectangular grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead.
    The status of each cell changes each turn of the game depending on the statuses of the cell's 8 neighbours.
    If the cell is alive,then it stays alive if it has either two or three live neighbours.
    If the cell is dead,then it springs to life only in the case that it has three live neighbours.
